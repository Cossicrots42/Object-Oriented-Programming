# Object-Oriented-Programming
-I am Malachi Mock, I'm going to SouthWest Tech, and I'll soon be taking the Object-Oriented-Programming course.
-This repository will hold the files of projects that I'll be assigned by the course. These projects will be significant because they will display my progress and show my understanding.
-I'm a 17 year old dude (He/They) who likes just about anything to do with computers, especially code. I started taking a class at SouthWest tech last year and I'm continuing to study. I work at a local pizza shop to win the bread, because no one can get enough of that. In my spare time, I play Minecraft and work for neighborhood clients. I've also been to France, it's a neat place. And I have dreams of being succesful in the Computer Science field and of owning a beach house. I consider myself smart, hard-working, and ambitous. But I'm not quite sure specifically what I'll do just yet. And yes, I do like women. I get that's kind of rare for people like me, but I guess I stand out.
-I am taking this program so that I can continue to advance my learning in Software Development and eventually obtain a succesful career that heavily involves computer programming.
